# magic-meeting

This project offers a simulation for a meeting, to be later on integrated with mixed-reality.
Using Magic Meeting, you can record the whole meeting while adding notes, comments, tasks and send messages and tasks to your peers and workers, by only 'playing' with your fingers on the table. 
The web should be run on your phone, and the meeting simulation is run using Unity.

* The project was done in a 3-day excercise for Magic Leap, to be later on integrated with the famous mixed-reality glasses and special gestures on the table in front of you, or any other surface.
