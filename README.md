# magic-meeting

This project offers a simulation for a meeting, to be later on integrated with mixed-reality equipment.
Using Magic Meeting, you can record the whole meeting while adding notes, comments, tasks and send voice messages and tasks to your colleagues, by only 'playing' with your fingers on the table. 

This repository contains only the meeting manager (server side and web interface), while the meeting simulation is run locally using Unity and sends events to the meeting manager. It's recommended using the management web interface from your phone.

* The project was done in a 3-day excercise for Magic Leap, to be later on integrated with the famous mixed-reality glasses and special gestures on the table in front of you, or any other surface.
